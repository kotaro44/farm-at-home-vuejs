# farm-at-home-vuejs

This is an VueJS Demo, to run the project you only need to clone the repository, once cloned inside the repo folder just run the command:

```javascript
$ npm install
```
The command will install the backend repository for this project from: https://github.com/kotaro44/farm-at-home-backend.git
and VueJS libraries.

To start the App run the following command:

```javascript
$ npm start
```

The command will run simultaneously the Backend server by default on port 3000 and the frontend on port 8081,
so you can access both services from http://localhost
